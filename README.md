# Nix flake wrapper for Ogmios

A simple light-weight wrapper around Ogmios for seamless integration with other Nix based systems.
This project will never attempt to do more, to keep it simple to maintain.

The `main` branch should follow the latest supported Ogmios version and older versions are tagged.
Feel free to open a PR if a new version is not supported by this repo.
